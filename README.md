# LEARN CPP WALKTHROUGH 🚶

Welcome to my adventure through the LearnCpp.com tutorials! This repository documents my progress, notes, and any projects or exercises I undertake as I review and learn more C++. 

This repo has been created to supplement my development of the Virtual Warehouse.

## Purpose 🎯:

The goal of this repository is to just keep track of my progress through the LearnCpp.com lessons and possibly provide alternative approaches to the problems encountered in the tutorials.

## Repository Structure 🏗️

- **lessons/** : Contains notes and summaries for each LearnCpp.com lesson.
  - Each lesson will have its own folder or file, e.g., `Lesson_1_1_Introduction_to_C++`.

## Progress 🚧

I'm currently at:
- **Lesson:** :|
- **Topic:** :|

## Future Plans 📆

- As I progress, I might tap into additional resources beyond LearnCpp.com. If this happens, this repository will be renamed to "Cpp Walkthrough" to reflect its broader scope.
